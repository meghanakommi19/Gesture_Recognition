# Gesture_Recognition
My repository contains the code for Gesture Recognition without using a separate dataset and training it contains 20 gestures inside the code with the landmarks it will identify the gesture for both left hand and right hand simultaneously.To execute this create virutal environment, if mediapipe works on your PC without creating the virtual environment then you run it directly by dowloading the required libraries if not create virtual environment and download the libraries. To create virtual environment first run python -m venv venv and after that run Venv\Scripts\activate
